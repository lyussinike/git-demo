Lie awake in bed at night
and think about your life
Do you want to be different?

Try to let go of the truth
the battles of your youth
Cause this is just a game

It's time to forget about the past
To wash away what happened last
Hide behind an empty face
Don't ask too much just say
Cause this is just a game

It's a beautiful lie
It's a perfect denial
Such a beautiful lie to believe in
So beautiful, beautiful lie it makes me
